# bus-mall

build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side)

The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

Bus-mall programatically allows the user to vote for 25 rounds which of 3 products shown do they like.

Each time the user clicks a product, the amount of times the product is viewed, and if the producted was clicked and gave a like is recorded.

The algorithim allows for random product generation; a instance of a specfic product can't be repeated within a round of voting, and can't be show up again within the next the next voting round.

Once the user completes 25 rounds of voting, the user will not be able to continue voting.

The results of the voting can be displayed when the user clicks on the view results button.

A chart will then be generated on the page containing the values for views, and likes on each product mapped in bar graph.

The purpose of this project is not to highlight my design of the site but rather the functionality of the site using javascript.
